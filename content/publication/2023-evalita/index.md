abstract: "The Assessing DIScourse COherence in Italian TEXts (DisCoTEX) task is the first shared task focused on modelling discourse coherence for Italian real-word texts, which has been proposed for the first time at EVALITA 2023. Providing two different datasets from different textual genres, we arranged the task into two independent tasks: a more traditional one, aimed at evaluating whether models are able to distinguish well-organized documents from corrupted ones and a less explored one, which assesses the modelsâ€™ performance on texts evaluated for coherence by human raters. In this paper, we describe the datasets released, we discuss the different approaches tackled by the participating systems and provide a first analysis of the obtained results."
