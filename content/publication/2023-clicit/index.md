abstract: "This paper presents a novel resource designed to study text coherence in the Italian language. The dataset aims to address existing deficiencies in coherence assessment by focusing on human perception of coherence. Recently, it has been integrated into the DiSCoTex benchmark, part of EVALITA 2023, the 8th evaluation campaign for NLP and speech tools in Italian. Our resource aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of coherence, highlighting the influence of both genre and text perturbations on perceived coherence."
