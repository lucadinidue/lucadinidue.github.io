abstract: The paper illustrates the results of a first experiment in which Natural Language Processing was used to support the revision of a children’s dictionary, in particular for what concerns style and wording of definitions and the enrichment of the list of lemmas. The results achieved are promising and demonstrate the potential of a synergy to be strengthened in the publishing sector.
