excerpt: 'We present a deep investigation of encoder-based Language Models (LMs) on their abilities to detect text coherence across four languages and four text genres using a new evaluation benchmark, TEXT-CAKE. We analyze both multilingual and monolingual LMs with varying architectures and parameters in different finetuning settings. Our findings demonstrate that identifying subtle perturbations that disrupt local coherence is still a challenging task. Furthermore, our results underline the importance of using diverse text genres during  pre-training and of an optimal pre-traning objective and large vocabulary size. When controlling for other parameters, deep LMs (i.e., higher number of layers) have an advantage over shallow ones, even when the total number of parameters is smaller.'
