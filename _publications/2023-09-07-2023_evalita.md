excerpt: 'The Assessing DIScourse COherence in Italian TEXts (DisCoTEX) task is the first shared task focused on modelling discourse coherence for Italian real-word texts, which has been proposed for the first time at EVALITA 2023. Providing two different datasets from different textual genres, we arranged the task into two independent tasks: a more traditional one, aimed at evaluating whether models are able to distinguish well-organized documents from corrupted ones and a less explored one, which assesses the models’ performance on texts evaluated for coherence by human raters. In this paper, we describe the datasets released, we discuss the different approaches tackled by the participating systems and provide a first analysis of the obtained results.'
