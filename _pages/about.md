I’m Luca, a third-year PhD student in the Italian National PhD Program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pisa. I work with the [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) at the Institute of Computational Linguistics "Antonio Zampolli" (CNR). My research focuses on enhancing Neural Language Models by integrating human data and advanced learning techniques to make these models more interpretable and data-efficient. Currently, I’m exploring the use of **eye-tracking data** and **curriculum learning** to  improve model performance and usability.
